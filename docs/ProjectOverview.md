# Project Overview

## 1. System Objectives
The project aims to solve the limited accessibility and promotion of local tourism services. Currently, tourists and visitors may struggle to find accurate information about destinations, accommodations, and activities. The portal will provide a centralized platform for browsing tourism options, booking services, and making simple simulated payments. It also addresses the challenge for local businesses by offering them an easy way to promote their services.

## 2. Proposed Scope
The system will include the following modules:
- **User Module** – Registration, login, service browsing, booking, and payment simulation.  
- **Tourism Listings Module** – Display destinations, accommodations, and activities with search and filter functionality.  
- **Booking Module** – Booking creation, confirmation, and history tracking.  
- **Payment Module** – Simulated payments (e.g., GCash simulation, cash on delivery, or mark as paid).  
- **Admin Module** – Add, edit, delete listings, and manage bookings.  

The project scope is limited to a **desktop web portal** with a simple, user-friendly interface.

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Tourists/Visitors** – End-users who browse destinations, book services, and process payments.  
- **Local Tourism Businesses** – Service providers who promote destinations and accommodations through the portal.  
- **System Administrator** – Manages tourism listings, bookings, and user transactions.  

## 4. Tools/Technologies
The following tools and technologies are expected to be used:  
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Database/Backend Services**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting)  
- **Development Tools**: VS Code, Git/GitHub  
- **Design Tools**: Figma/Canva for UI wireframes  
- **Other**: Browser-based testing tools, Postman for API testing
